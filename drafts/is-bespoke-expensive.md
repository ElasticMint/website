# How much does custom software cost?
Technology is moving on at an ever increasing rate and forcing businesses to re-evaluate how to operate effectively.  The processes and software that were fit for purpose five or ten years ago were created for a different world. 

The companies that are succeeding in today's world are using software to their advantage.  They are improving their business processes with software. They are improving their business decision-making with software.  They are helping employees become more efficient with software.  They are making their business easier to run with software.  

Companies that don't invest in the necessary software improvements will find it harder to understand how their business is operating.  They'll find it harder to react to the data they have because it takes longer to process. They'll find it harder to engage with new or larger markets. In short, they'll find it harder to improve and thrive.

Software development is a complex process and can end up being costly and ineffective if not done right.

The decision to invest in a new web app, website or software solution is born from the need for a business to either make money or save money. 

Custom software can make your business money by increasing efficiency, allowing you to get more done in less time.  It can simplify business processes, reducing waste caused by human-error.  Integrating different parts of the business using custom software can result in faster, more accurate processing with fewer mistakes.

Once the decision has been made to invest in new software, the next questions are how much it will cost and how long it will take?  The answer to these questions will determine whether the ROI (return on investment) makes the project worthwhile. 

Arriving at the answer to these questions takes a bit of thought and a lot of communication.

Let's use car building as an analogy. If I wanted to know how much it would cost to build a car I wouldn't be able to get a meaningful estimate of price and time without some more detail. Some basic details we would need are how many passengers it should carry, how many wheels it should have, how big the engine should be, and whether it should run on petrol, diesel or even electricity.

Even if we had the answer to these basic questions, we would still only be able to give a very broad range in terms of cost and time. If this broad range was within my car-building budget then I would be able to start to have a more detailed conversation with the car builder and arrive at a narrower range.  Once we got to a range and level of detail I was comfortable with then we could sign on the dotted line and start building. 

What's the right level of detail?  I probably wouldn't want to specify the exact make of rivets or the exact length of brake hose to use.  These are details that the car builder can deal with.  There are some decisions I might have to make early on and some I can defer.  If I have an exotic material and colour for seats then I might have to make that decision earlier so that the materials can be ordered and the seats made in time to be fitted.

Software development is similar in that we can provide very broad estimates for different types of software development based on other similar projects we may have worked on.  If these estimates are acceptable then we can work with you to further understand the scope of work and come up with a plan of work and a cost associated with that plan.

How much does bespoke software cost?

One of the challenges for the software industry over the years has been estimating accurately how long a project will take to deliver and how much it will cost. It seems that every few months there is a news article about an abandoned project or one that has gone way over budget e.g. £12.7 billion was spent on the NHS National Programme for IT before it was finally abandoned (https://www.digitalhealth.net/2016/07/national-programme-for-it-ends-but-not-for-everyone/). The UK government's Universal Credit system was due to be introduced in 2017 at a cost of £2 billion. It is currently not expected to be fully operational until 2022 at a cost of £15.8 billion.

This is an extreme example, but there are a number of challenges common to most software projects.
* Changing technologies
* Incomplete or poorly-understood requirements
* Scope creep

Despite our best efforts it is very rare for all the requirements of any software application to be known and understood, and so if we're not careful we end up a bit like Dilbert - http://dilbert.com/strip/2009-12-07. The project manager asks for an estimate while admitting she has no scope or design yet. Dilbert responds with a very large number plucked out of the air. The project manager asks how he has come up with that estimate as he knows nothing about the project. "That makes two of us!" he replies.

The first step in estimating the cost has to be getting a feel for the size of the project. A very small project with a clearly defined scope can be relatively easily priced. This would be something like a line of business web application which allows users to view and modify data held in a database on perhaps 10 or 20 pages and without any complicated user interface behaviour.
