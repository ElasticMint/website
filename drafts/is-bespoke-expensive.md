# Is There Value In Bespoke Software?

Software development is a complex process and can end up being costly and ineffective if not done right.

Once the decision has been made to invest in new software, the next questions are how much it will cost and how long it will take?  The answer to these questions will determine whether the ROI (return on investment) makes the project worthwhile. 

Arriving at the answer to these questions takes a bit of thought and a lot of communication.

To get the best value from your new software you need to work with a partner that understands what your business goals are and what type of software can add the most value. Once you've had those conversations and reached a common understanding your software development partner should be able to come up with a plan to help realise your goals.  It's at this stage that estimating the price becomes a little easier. 

If the project is small and very well defined then a fixed price can be a good approach.  Your software partner will deliver the software by a date for an agreed price. There will be little, if any, chance to change the specification and if changes are required then it usually adds to the cost.

If the project is larger and the exact requirements are less well known then there are a couple of options.

- The requirements can be analysed and a comprehensive specification can be produced for a project so that it can be delivered for a fixed price.  It requires a large amount of effort (and cost) to comprehensively document absolutely everything that the software needs to do.  More often than not, specifications produced using this process are not as comprehensive as first thought and the fixed price nature of this work means that errors and omissions can become very costly.

 - The project can be treated more holistically where the aim is to meet the overall business goal by developing the software to help achieve that.  Your software partner will work in a more collaborative way with you to deliver working software in smaller, useable features.  Users of the new software will be able to give feedback as the software system is being developed and this feedback can be used to shape the system as it is being developed.  These types of projects are usually priced using  'time & materials' whereby a software development team are paid a daily rate to produce the software.

## Fixed-price projects

In our experience, businesses initially prefer the fixed-price model.  It gives a feeling of certainty by being able to plan the cost and project timeline.  The risk is carried by the software partner and there are often penalties if the software is delivered on time.  To mitigate against this, the software partner has to protect themself by estimating the risk and adding that into the project cost. In a short project (anything up to a month of work for a single person) this risk is usually very small and fixed-pricing can be an appropriate model.  Once you start getting into the realms of multiple developers for multiple months then the risks get larger and so the mitigation cost increases.

## Where is the value in a time and materials pricing model?

It may seem counter-intuitive to prefer an time and materials approach. It appears initially that there is more to the business than to the software partner. If the software takes longer to deliver or more people are required to complete the project then it will cost more.  

However, if we start to think about the value this approach can provide to a business we can see it might make more sense to work this way.

One of the problems with fixing the price, cost and scope of a project is that all of those things are fixed.  This might seem like a good thing until you consider that it is very common to discover problems that hadn't been thought of beforehand during the development of your software.  Businesses can change during the lifecycle of a project and features that were deemed critical at the start of a project no longer add value to the business goals.  As business goals evolve, new features might be required during the project lifecycle. A fixed-price project makes the cost of change very expensive.

Taking a time and materials approach combined with some collaborative software development techniques allows a business more flexibility in the shape of the final software solution. Work can be split into small, feature-based pieces of work that can be easier to estimate, prioritise,build and deliver. With regular, good-quality communication these smaller pieces of work can be run like mini-projects. Each project can result in a working piece of software to be used immediately.  The order in which a feature is developed can easily be changed to meet changing business needs.  A feature can easily be removed from the list of work to be done if it becomes unimportant to the business. 

In short, the value to be had in this approach is a better chance of building the right software that bests meets the goals of your business through a collaborative partnership.

All businesses are at a different stage in their lives and require different solutions to different problems.  There is no on-size-fits-all approach to bespoke software development but with the right software partner your business can increase it's new software's bang-for-buck.

















# How much does custom software cost?
Technology is moving on at an ever increasing rate and forcing businesses to re-evaluate how to operate effectively.  The processes and software that were fit for purpose five or ten years ago were created for a different world. 

The companies that are succeeding in today's world are using software to their advantage.  They are improving their business processes with software. They are improving their business decision-making with software.  They are helping employees become more efficient with software.  They are making their business easier to run with software.  

Companies that don't invest in the necessary software improvements will find it harder to understand how their business is operating.  They'll find it harder to react to the data they have because it takes longer to process. They'll find it harder to engage with new or larger markets. In short, they'll find it harder to improve and thrive.

Software development is a complex process and can end up being costly and ineffective if not done right.

The decision to invest in a new web app, website or software solution is born from the need for a business to either make money or save money. 

Custom software can make your business money by increasing efficiency, allowing you to get more done in less time.  It can simplify business processes, reducing waste caused by human-error.  Integrating different parts of the business using custom software can result in faster, more accurate processing with fewer mistakes.

Once the decision has been made to invest in new software, the next questions are how much it will cost and how long it will take?  The answer to these questions will determine whether the ROI (return on investment) makes the project worthwhile. 

Arriving at the answer to these questions takes a bit of thought and a lot of communication.

Let's use car building as an analogy. If I wanted to know how much it would cost to build a car I wouldn't be able to get a meaningful estimate of price and time without some more detail. Some basic details we would need are how many passengers it should carry, how many wheels it should have, how big the engine should be, and whether it should run on petrol, diesel or even electricity.

Even if we had the answer to these basic questions, we would still only be able to give a very broad range in terms of cost and time. If this broad range was within my car-building budget then I would be able to start to have a more detailed conversation with the car builder and arrive at a narrower range.  Once we got to a range and level of detail I was comfortable with then we could sign on the dotted line and start building. 

What's the right level of detail?  I probably wouldn't want to specify the exact make of rivets or the exact length of brake hose to use.  These are details that the car builder can deal with.  There are some decisions I might have to make early on and some I can defer.  If I have an exotic material and colour for seats then I might have to make that decision earlier so that the materials can be ordered and the seats made in time to be fitted.

Software development is similar in that we can provide very broad estimates for different types of software development based on other similar projects we may have worked on.  If these estimates are acceptable then we can work with you to further understand the scope of work and come up with a plan of work and a cost associated with that plan.

# How much does bespoke software cost?

One of the challenges for the software industry over the years has been estimating accurately how long a project will take to deliver and how much it will cost. It seems that every few months there is a news article about an abandoned project or one that has gone way over budget e.g. £12.7 billion was spent on the NHS National Programme for IT before it was finally abandoned (https://www.digitalhealth.net/2016/07/national-programme-for-it-ends-but-not-for-everyone/). The UK government's Universal Credit system was due to be introduced in 2017 at a cost of £2 billion. It is currently not expected to be fully operational until 2022 at a cost of £15.8 billion.

This is an extreme example, but there are a number of challenges common to most software projects.
* Changing technologies
* Incomplete or poorly-understood requirements
* Scope creep

Despite our best efforts it is very rare for all the requirements of any software application to be known and understood, and so if we're not careful we end up a bit like Dilbert - http://dilbert.com/strip/2009-12-07. The project manager asks for an estimate while admitting she has no scope or design yet. Dilbert responds with a very large number plucked out of the air. The project manager asks how he has come up with that estimate as he knows nothing about the project. "That makes two of us!" he replies.

The first step in estimating the cost has to be getting a feel for the size of the project. A very small project with a clearly defined scope can be relatively easily priced. This would be something like a line of business web application which allows users to view and modify data held in a database on perhaps 10 or 20 pages and without any complicated user interface behaviour.

Let's use car building as an analogy. In order to work out how much it would cost to build a car some basic details would be needed e.g. how many passengers it should carry, how many wheels it should have, how big the engine should be, and what fuel it should run on.

Even with the answer to these basic questions, it's still only possible to give a very broad range in terms of cost and time. If this broad range is within car-building budget then more detailed conversation with the car builder can start in order to arrive at a narrower range. Once we get to a range and level of detail that is comfortable for both parties, contracts can be signed and building can start.
