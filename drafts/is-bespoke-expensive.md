# How much does custom software cost?
Technology is moving on at an ever increasing rate and forcing businesses to re-evaluate how to operate effectively.  The processes and software that were fit-for-purpose five or ten years ago were created for a different world. 

The companies that are succeeding in todays world are using software to their advantage.  They are improving their business processes with software. They are improving their business decision-making with software.  They are helping employees become more efficient with software.  They are making their business easier to run with software.  

Companies that don't invest in the necessary software improvements will find it harder to understand how their business is operating.  They'll find it harder to react to the data they have because it takes longer to process.  They'll find it harder to engage with new or larger markets. In short, they'll find it harder to improve and thrive.

Software development is a complex process and can end up being costly and ineffective if not done right.

The decision to invest in a new web app, website or software solution is born from the need for a business to either make money or save money. 

Custom software can make your business money by increasing efficiency, allowing you to get more done in less time.  It can simplify business processes, reducing waste caused by human-error.  Integrating different parts of the business using custom software can result in faster, more accurate processing with fewer mistakes.

Once the decision has been made to invest in new software, the next questions are how much will it cost and how long will it take?  The answer to these questions will determine whether the ROI (return on investment) makes the project worthwhile. 

Arriving at the answer to these questions takes a bit of thought and a lot of communication.

Let's use car building as an analogy. If I wanted to know how much it would cost to build a car I wouldn't be able to get a meaningful estimate of price and time without some more detail. Some basic details we would need are how many passengers should it carry, how many wheels should it have, how big should the engine be, should it be petrol or diesel?  

Even if we had the answer to these basic questions, we would still only be able to give a very broad range in terms of cost and time. If this broad range is within my car-building budget then I can start to have more detailed with the car builder and we can arrive at a narrower range.  Once we get to a range and level of detail I'm confortable with then we can sign on the dotted line and start building. 

What's the right level of detail?  I probably wouldn't want to specify the exact make of rivets or the exact length of brake hose to use.  These are details that the car builder can deal with.  There are some decisions I might have to make early on and some I can defer.  If I have an exotic material and colour for seats then I might have to make that decision earlier so that the materials can be ordered and the seats made in time to be fitted.

Software development is similar in that we can provide very broad estimates for different types of software development based on other similar projects we may have worked on.  If these estimates are acceptable then we can work with you to further understand the scope of work and come up with a plan of work and a cost associated with that plan.
