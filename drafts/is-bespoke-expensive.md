# How To Get The Best Value From Bespoke Software?

Software development is a complex process and can end up being costly and ineffective if not done right.

Once the decision has been made to invest in new software, the next questions are how much it will cost and how long it will take?  The answer to these questions will determine whether the ROI (return on investment) makes the project worthwhile. 

Arriving at the answer to these questions takes a bit of thought and a lot of communication.

To get the best value from your new software you need to work with a partner that understands what your business goals are and what type of software can add the most value. Once you've had those conversations and reached a common understanding your software development partner should be able to come up with a plan to develop the software that helps realise your goals. 

## Fixed-price projects

In our experience, businesses initially think of a fixed-price model.  It gives a feeling of certainty by being able to plan the cost and the project timeline.  Your software partner will deliver the software by a date for an agreed price. There will be little, if any, chance to change the specification and if changes are required then it usually adds to the cost. The risk is carried by the software partner and there are often penalties if the software is not delivered on time.  To mitigate against this the software partner has to protect themself by estimating the risk and adding that into the project cost. In a short project (anything up to a month of work for a single person) this risk is usually very small and fixed-price can be an appropriate model.  Once you start getting into the realms of multiple month and multiple developer projects then the risks get larger and so the mitigation cost increases.

If the project is larger and the exact requirements are less well known then there are a couple of options.

- The requirements can be analysed and a comprehensive specification can be produced for a project so that it can be delivered for a fixed price.  It requires a large amount of effort (and cost) to comprehensively document absolutely everything that the software needs to do.  More often than not, specifications produced using this process are not as comprehensive as first thought and the fixed price nature of this work means that errors and omissions can become very costly.

 - The project can be treated more holistically where the aim is to meet the overall business goal by developing the software. Your software partner will work in a more collaborative way with you to deliver working software in smaller, useable features.  Users of the new software will be able to give feedback as the software system is being developed and this feedback can be used to shape the system as it is being developed.  These types of projects are usually priced using  'time & materials' whereby a software development team are paid a daily rate to produce the software.


## Time and materials projects?

It may seem counter-intuitive to prefer an time and materials approach. It appears initially that there is more risk to the business than to the software partner. If the software takes longer to deliver or more people are required to complete the project then it will cost more.  

However, cost is only one aspect and if we start to think about the value this approach can provide to a business we can see it might make more sense to work this way.

One of the problems with fixing the price, cost and scope of a project is that all of those things are fixed.  This might seem like a good thing until you consider that it is very common to discover problems that hadn't been thought of beforehand during the development of software. Things in a business can change during the lifecycle of a project and features that were deemed critical at the start of a project no longer add value.  As business goals evolve, new features might be required. A fixed-price, fixed-scope project makes the cost of change very expensive.

Taking a time and materials approach combined with some collaborative software development techniques allows a business more flexibility in the shape of the final software solution. Work can be split into small, feature-based pieces of work that can be easier to estimate, prioritise,build and deliver. With regular, good-quality communication these smaller pieces of work can be run like mini-projects. Each project can result in a working piece of software to be used immediately.  The order in which a feature is developed can easily be changed to meet changing business needs.  A feature can easily be removed from the list of work to be done if it becomes unimportant to the business. A new feature can easily be added to the list.

In short, the value to be had in this approach is a better chance of building the right software that bests meets the goals of your business through a collaborative partnership.

All businesses are at a different stage in their lives and require different solutions to different problems.  There is no on-size-fits-all approach to bespoke software development but with the right software partner your business can increase it's new software's bang-for-buck.
