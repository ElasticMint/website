# What is bespoke software

Bespoke is just a fancy word for custom, right? Well, yes. And no.

The word originated shoemaking, but gained in popularity through custom tailoring in England, where lengths of cloths were said to be “spoken for” or “bespoken” by another customer.  There are several levels of custom made clothes.  

- The first is `made-to-order`, where a customer tries on a stock garment, and then picks out certain trimmings or materials for his order. The cut is the same, but the materials are customized to his preference.

- The second is `made-to-measure`, where in addition to picking out the materials and trimmings, a customer’s measurements are taken. Those measurements are used to adjust a pre-existing stock pattern for a customization of not only the materials, but also of the cut.

- The third is `bespoke`, where not only the cut and selection of materials are customized, but the garment is made through a series of fittings. The key difference between bespoke and made-to-measure is that with made-to-measure, you typically only get one fitting, whereas in bespoke, you usually get more. In addition, anything on the garment is customizable.

Bespoke tailoring, and custom tailoring generally, is never right the first time. Getting a perfect fit requires a long-term relationship and typically at least two or three garments, even for a great tailor. (2)

At Elastic Mint, we offer bespoke software development.  Our intent is to develop a long term relationship with our customers.  When we deliver software, we deliver small, useable features regularly. These features build up to make the software application being developed. Delivering these small, useable features means that our customers get to use parts of the application as soon as they are ready, to try them out for size so to speak.  If any adjustments to the feature are required, we can make those adjustments.
