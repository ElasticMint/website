                    Most modern web applications rely on APIs. These APIs might be microservices each with their own datastore to support their functionality, or they
                    might just be a focussed API which is part of a distributed monolith. Increasingly we are seeing APIs being used to share data between businesses and
                    public APIs which provide the data which is then visualised according to different people's needs.

                    Whatever your needs, you can rest assured that Elastic Mint don't take a one size fits all approach. We are well aware for example of the current trend 
                    towards microservices, but we also understand that there are tradeoffs in every design. We work with our customers to understand their needs and then 
                    design the right API for them.
