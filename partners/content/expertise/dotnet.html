                    At Elastic Mint we pride ourselves on our expertise when it comes to Microsoft's .Net technologies. Due to our focus
                    on hiring experienced developers, many of our staff have been working with .Net since its early days. What this means is we
                    bring a depth of knowledge to all we do .Net.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our preference will always be to use the latest .Net technologies allowing us to benefit from the most recent features. However,
                    we are not phased when a customer asks us to look at an older codebase. Our language of choice tends to be C#, but when appropriate 
                    we are happy to work with VB .Net and F# too.
