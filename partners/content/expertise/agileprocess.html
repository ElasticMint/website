                The word Agile has been bandied about for so many years now that for many people it has lost all meaning. We don't subscribe to any one Agile process like
                Scrum or Kanban. Rather we go back to the basic principles of the Agile manifesto where we value people over processes, working software over comprehensive
                documentation, collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.
            </p>
            <p>Based on these principles, we will always do the three following things:</p>

            <div class="col-md-4">

                </div>
                <div class="box-text engage">
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <h3>Engage</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        We engage with our customers to properly understand the problem they are trying to solve.

                    <p>
                        You would be forgiven for thinking that there is nothing particularly differentiating about
                        this. Any company worth its salt would seek to understand what the requirement is and in this
                        we are no different.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where we differ from others is that we take a very flexible approach that allows for a certain
                        amount of change in need and requirement along the way. With this in mind we seek to adopt a
                        way of working and develop software that allows for change. We recognise businesses constantly
                        evolve and business needs change over the course of development.

                    <p>
                        We automate the build, test and deployment process so we can concentrate on developing
                        new features.

                        Automation is important because it delivers incremental business benefit from the outset
                        and builds in scope and capability until project completion. This has 3 key benefits because it:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Delivers incremental value to the business. Even if the project is curtailed
                            value is still generated.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Allows for changes in budget or scope along the way if required.

                        We work with businesses to identify which features add the most value and regularly 
                        deliver fully working, usable software.

                        We do not ascribe to the "big reveal" software development process. We deliver 
                        incremental business benefit from outset until completions so that the business gets 
                        the maximum possible benefit.
