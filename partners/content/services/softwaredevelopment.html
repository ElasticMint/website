                <p>Elastic Mint are a team of experts with many years experience in developing software.</p>
                <p>
                    We have worked on a wide variety of applications ranging from e-commerce sites written in ASP.Net
                    deployed to both AWS and Azure, to small web applications deployed on a single server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we are happy to turn our hands to any technology, our main focus is on the Microsoft stack
                    e.g. .Net Core, EF Core, SQL Server, Razor pages, Azure. We like these tools because they are
                    well-supported with good documentation and there are always new developments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Elastic Mint we are always looking at new technologies to see how they can benefit our customers.
                    At the moment we are closely looking at Blazor and how it enables us to build the whole stack of an
                    application with C#. This should be a real benefit to our clients after they take over support of the software
                    we have built as the same person should be able to understand and work on the full stack.
