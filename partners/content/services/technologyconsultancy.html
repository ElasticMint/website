                    At Elastic Mint we specialise in providing technology experts who can advise on technology choices based on many years of experience.

                    This enables us to give reliable advice to senior management who need to make strategic decisions. It also enables us to join
                    existing teams and give them guidance on how to get the most out of the technologies they are using, and the practices they need
                    to follow to be successful.

                    One example of this was for a company who have a number of APIs which read data from Elasticsearch. These APIs had a number of 
                    tests running as part of the build, however they relied on a deployed instance of Elasticsearch, and ultimately were both slow and 
                    unreliable. We introduced a library enabling these tests to run against an in-memory version of Elasticsearch. This enabled multiple
                    test runs to occur at the same time without interfering with each other, ultimately leading to faster and more reliable tests. Having
                    implemented this library we delivered a tech talk for their engineering department to share the knowledge and then provided support
                    to developers as they added similar tests to other APIs.
