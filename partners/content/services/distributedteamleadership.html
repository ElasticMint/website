                    Increasingly companies have distributed teams of developers working in multiple locations. Sometimes these developers are all
                    in the same country, and sometimes they are spread all around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with distributed teams is hard. Different time-zones, languages and cultures all conspire to make communication difficult,
                    which can lead to problems like misunderstood requirements and lack of cohesion within teams.

                    From Elastic Mint's earliest days we have used technology to enable us to work with our clients and their development teams. We 
                    understand the importance of being responsive to messages, and when we need to jump on a video call to talk something through. Having
                    led distributed teams for our clients we understand the importance of strong leaders who have the time to resolve misunderstandings. We
                    recognise how cultural differences can lead to people not behaving in the way we expect, and have developed strategies to overcome these
                    challenges, and to build trust between team members. This then enables team members to collaborate more effectively helping them to deliver
                    better software more quickly.
