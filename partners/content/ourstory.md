We've each been developing software for between fifteen and twenty years and met whilst working as contractors at the same company. We kept in touch as we each moved on to various other companies and, through discussions over time, we had the idea that a small team of expert software developers could be very effective and cost-efficient at designing and delivering software. With all the experience we had acquired over the years we felt the time was right to set up a company that could help others achieve their business goals, with the help of software, in a way that offers tangible value very early on.  

Elastic Mint was born from the desire to deliver excellent software using smaller teams of extremely experienced developers. Collaboration, communication and a shared understanding of business goals feature highly in our way of working. [Contact us](/#contact)  if you would like our help to design and deliver an upcoming project or would like to talk about an idea you have for a software solution to your business goals.
