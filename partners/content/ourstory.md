Andy, Jon and Gordon are software developers. It's what they do. They enjoy developing good quality software. It makes them happy.  They've each been developing software for between fifteen and twenty years.  

They met whilst working as contractors at Just Eat and kept in touch as they each moved on to various other companies.  They had the idea that a small team of expert software developers could be very effective and cost-efficient at designing and delivering software. With all the experience they had acquired over the years they felt the time was right to set up a company that could help others achieve their business goals, with the help of software, in a way that offers tangible value very early on.  

Elastic Mint was born from the desire to deliver excellent software using smaller teams of extremely experienced developers. Collaboration, communication and a shared understanding of business goals feature highly in our way of working.
