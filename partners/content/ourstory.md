Elastic Mint was born from the desire to deliver excellent software using smaller teams of extremely experienced developers. Collaboration, communication and a shared understanding of business goals feature highly in our way of working. 

As founders of Elastic Mint weâ€™ve been developing software for between fifteen and twenty years.   We met whilst working as contractors at the same company and kept in touch as we each moved on to various other opportunities.  Through discussions over time, we had the idea that as a small team of expert software developers we could be very effective and cost-efficient at designing and delivering software. With the experience we had acquired over the years we felt the time was right to set up a company that could help others achieve their business goals, with the help of software, in a way that offers tangible value very early on.
