## The Client

Microsoft Research in Cambridge brings together talented researchers and engineers to explore different ways that technology can benefit us. Areas of research include Artifical Intelligence, Cloud Infrastructure and how technology can enable different ways of working.

## The Challenge

At any one time there are many research projects in progress. Microsoft Research wanted a solution that would enable them to showcase these different projects internally within Microsoft, highlighting their aims and goals, how they were progressing, and who was involved with different projects. Starting with a few wireframes for different pages, they engaged Elastic Mint to develop a small CMS enabling them to administer project data and present it to their users.

## The Solution

Working closely with one of Microsoft's Graphic Designers, Elastic Mint built a .Net Core web application with Razor Pages, Entity Framework Core and SQL Server. Key to the success of this application was that it showcased Microsoft's research projects in a clear and consistent way.

Through automating deployment to a test environment, we were able to quickly demonstrate progress and get rapid feedback, ultimately leading to a solution that met Microsoft's needs.
