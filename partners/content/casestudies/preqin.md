## The Client

Preqin is a leading source of data and intelligence for the alternative assets industry. Through their online tools, they provide data and information on investment funds in the private equity, real estate, hedge fund, infrastructure, private debt and natural resource sectors to support fundraising, marketing and market research.

## First Contact

Preqin were approaching the end of a project to develop a new version of their investment intelligence software to provide a better experience for their users.
Under pressure to meet their deadlines, they engaged Elastic Mint to provide some “extra muscle”. Key to their requirements was that Elastic Mint could provide a team experienced enough to hit the ground running so as not to add a burden to their already busy team.

An Elastic Mint team was deployed to focus on moving fund-related data from their SQL Server database into Elasticsearch, and then exposing that data through a .Net Core web service to the user interface.
Our first task was to understand their business, meet the development team and get up to speed with the current state of the project...quickly!

Through open conversation and collaboration we rapidly built trust with the existing team. Recognising the tight deadline they were working to, and the challenges they had already faced on the project, we looked to where we could add the most value in the least disruptive way.

Focussing specifically on the hedge fund area of the application, we were involved in making design and architectural decisions, carrying out spikes to test ideas, and investigating solutions to problems that arose. We worked closely with developers from Preqin, helping to solve problems both inside and outside of the immediate scope of work, sharing knowledge and ultimately producing a solution that met Preqin’s needs.

## Building a Partnership

Following the successful delivery of Preqin's investment intelligence platform we built on the close relationships we had with key stakeholders in their engineering team to form a partnership where we could share our knowledge and experience. 

Initially Elastic Mint worked with Preqin's new Programme Manager and Scrum Master, helping to drive the adoption of Scrum within teams and providing leadership on Scrum practices and setting an example through leading one of their teams. Following on from this we provided an architect who began working with Preqin's architect to provide technical leadership. Both of these roles have been invaluable to Preqin as they have rapidly grown a large team in Bangalore, India, who have appreciated the support they have received from Elastic Mint's experienced staff.
