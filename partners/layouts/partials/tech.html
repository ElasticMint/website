                            <p>Elastic Mint are a team of experts with many years experience in developing software.</p>
                            <p>
                                We have worked on a wide variety of applications ranging from e-commerce sites written in ASP.Net
                                deployed to both AWS and Azure, to small web applications deployed on a single server.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While we are happy to turn our hands to any technology, our main focus is on the Microsoft stack
                                e.g. .Net Core, EF Core, SQL Server, Razor pages, Azure. We like these tools because they are
                                well-supported with good documentation and there are always new developments.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At Elastic Mint we are always looking at new technologies to see how they can benefit our customers.
                                At the moment we 
                                are closely looking at Blazor and how it enables us to build the whole stack of an application
                                with C#. This could be a real benefit to our clients after they take over support of the software
                                we have built as the same person should be able to understand and work on the full stack.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We value practices such as Continuous Integration and Deployment, and Test Driven Development.
                                This allows us to quickly deploy new versions of our software to an environment and rapidly
                                gain feedback from our clients, thus allowing us to easily adapt to any changing requirements.
