                    <p>You might recognise our values. When we came together as a partnership one of the first things we
                        did was to list all the things we would always do and all the things we would never do. For example,
                        some of things that appeared in the 'always do' list were to be open and transparent about what we
                        do, communicate both good and bad news, work collaboratively and deliver software we are proud of.
                        Some of the things in the 'never do' list included ignoring customer feedback and delivering low
                        quality work. When we looked at what we had come up with we realised that all of these things are
                        summed up nicely by the Extreme Programming values.</p>

                                        Working in small, simple steps means we can get feedback sooner. This, in turn, allows
                                        people we work with to make more informed decisions about what to develop next and
                                        allows the early mitigation of failures. Another benefit of simplicty is that the
                                        cost of change is lowered, making our software easier to maintain and extend. </li>

                                        to gain feedback from the people we are working with and can plan what to do next
                                        based on that feedback. We will talk about the project and remain flexible enough
                                        to adapt our process to it, not the other way around.</li>
