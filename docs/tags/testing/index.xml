      <description>I first learnt about writing unit tests following a project where we missed the deadline and spent far too long fixing and then refixing the code. I became frustrated that we would fix one thing and then something else would go wrong.

On my next project I determined to write tests as I went along and to be honest I&amp;rsquo;ve never looked back.</description>
