      <description>Do you remember the first time you used an ORM (Object Relational Mapper)? For me it was something I wrote to make it easier to map data related to testing electronic devices into a SQL database. Different devices generated different test data, and so I used a convention to map the property names on the classes to the SQL tables and columns. At the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what an ORM was.</description>

      <description>What is bespoke software? Bespoke is just a fancy word for custom, right? Well, yes. And no.
According to putthison.com the word &amp;lsquo;originated in shoemaking, but gained in popularity through custom tailoring in England, where lengths of cloths were said to be “spoken for” or “bespoken” by another customer.&amp;rsquo; 1 There are several levels of custom-made clothes:
 Made-to-order - only the materials are customised Made-to-measure - the materials and the cut are tailored based on a single fitting Bespoke - garments are made through a series of fittings  Translating this into software development, we can think of &amp;lsquo;made-to-measure&amp;rsquo; as being like a fixed-scope, Waterfall development process, where we get the requirements up-front, build the software and then deliver it.</description>
