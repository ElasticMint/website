      <description>Sometimes it seems that we simply go from one extreme to another. Once upon a time developers didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to write tests. Everything was tested manually. When changes were made the whole thing would need to be manually tested again. Sometimes we used test scripts, other times we just played around trying to break functionally. And then we couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember what we had done to break it!
Managers would roll their eyes in frustration when developers talked about writing unit tests.</description>

      <description>On 19th March Gordon and I attended a 2 day agile coding retreat in St Austell, Cornwall. Hosted by Kevlin Henney and Jon Jagger the retreat was organised for developers to discuss, practice and improve their software craftsmanship, communication and creativity. Having personally never attended such an event before I was interested to see if there was an opportunity for me to hone my programming skills to ultimately improve my performance as a developer.</description>
